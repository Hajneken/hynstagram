# Hynstagram

Web app where only images are a valid way of communication.

(I may or may not have been slighlty inspired with the name elsewhere).

## Motivation 

This fun little project has been written as a requirement for the course 4iz278 - Web Applications.

## Technologies 

This web application uses a traditional 3-layer architecture - Client ðŸ’», Server ðŸ§  + DataBase ðŸ’¾.

The logic of the app is written mainly in PHP, using MySQL database as a storage.

- PHP 
- MySQL 
- ES6
- yarn 
- Bootstrap

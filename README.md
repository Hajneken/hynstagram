# Hynstagram

Web app where only images are a valid way of communication.

(I may or may not have been slighlty inspired with the name elsewhere).

This fun little project has been written as a requirement for the course 4iz278 - Web Applications at Prague School of Economics .


## Getting started (Development)

1) install *yarn*
2) run `yarn` in project's root
3) run `gulp watch` to build your css and serve files
4) 🎉 you are set up 🎉

## Just want to run the app?

All magic happens within `/app`, you don't need anything else

1) copy contents of `/app` to server
2) Create 3 tables in MySQL database
   1)  **Users**
   2)  **Topics** 
   3)  **Posts**
3) You're set up
    
> message me for further details regarding the database

## Technologies 

This web application uses a traditional 3-layer architecture - Client 💻, Server 🧠 + DataBase 💾.

The logic of the app is written mainly in PHP, using MySQL database as a storage.
